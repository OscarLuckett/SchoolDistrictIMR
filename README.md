# Questions

* What are GeoId's exactly?  Can we map all of the GeoId's?  Or can we map all of the NYC schools?

* What is the most granular census data we can find for NYC?

* Why exactly did Monarrez drop NYC from his analysis?  Do we need to use a different city?

"I use geographic information systems (GIS) data on the 2013-14 school boundaries of nearly every urban school district in the country, combined with 2010 census block data on the racial composition of neighborhoods, to understand how school boundaries affect racial segregation in school assignments."

"I study school boundaries using the NCES 2013-14 School Attendance Boundary Survey (SABS), a nationally representative survey of local school assignment policies."

"Footnotes: 9-The SABS recently released a second wave of this survey covering boundaries for the 2015-16 school year. I focus on the first wave for 2013-14 given my use of 2010 census block data to measure residential composition."

"The analysis focuses on elementary school boundaries because they are more numerous than middle or high schools, generating a richer context for the district’s school boundary drawing problem. Additionally, elementary schools are often feeder schools, such that the boundaries of middle and high schools are approximate unions of elementary school boundaries. In this sense elementary school boundaries usually generate the most consequential student assign- ments across all K-12 grade levels. "

"The average SAB has a total population of about 9,600 residents, 618 of which are aged 5 to 9 years, with an enrollment to population ratio (for grades K-4) of 84%, and an average student distance to school of about 2.75 kilometers. Column (2) shows how the sample changes when I drop de facto school districts (i.e. districts that serve a single school for each grade level) and those that exclusively use nonresidential assignments. The majority of districts dropped here are rural, but this restriction also gets rid of the largest district in the country, New York City Schools. This is reflected in the mean SAB characteristics, with a decrease in both average population and distance to school."
